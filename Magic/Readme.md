# Virtual Magic Show 

This is a simple virtual magic trick built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a card trick where the user selects a card, and the application "magically" reveals it.

## How to Run

1. **Save the code:** Copy the provided HTML code and save it as an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`).
2. **Open in browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How it Works

The magic trick consists of three stages:

1. **Welcome:** The user is greeted with a welcome message and a button to start the trick.
2. **Card Selection:** 12 cards are displayed, and the user is asked to select one and remember it.
3. **Reveal:** The application simulates performing magic and then reveals the user's selected card.

**Key features:**

* **Card Deck:** A standard 52-card deck is created and shuffled using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
* **Card Selection:** When the user clicks a card, it's stored as the `selectedCard`.
* **Magic Simulation:** A timeout function simulates the "magic" being performed.
* **Reveal:** The `selectedCard` is revealed as the "predicted" card.

**Code Structure:**

* **HTML:** Defines the structure of the page with elements for the title, instructions, cards, button, and prediction.
* **CSS:** Styles the elements to create the visual appearance of the cards and the overall layout.
* **JavaScript:**
    * Creates and shuffles the card deck.
    * Handles user interaction (card selection, button clicks).
    * Manages the different stages of the magic trick.
    * Implements the core logic for revealing the selected card.

## Possible Enhancements

* **Improved visuals:** Add more visual flair with animations or transitions.
* **More complex tricks:** Implement more sophisticated card tricks or illusions.
* **User interface:** Enhance the user interface with more interactive elements.
* **Sound effects:** Add sound effects to create a more immersive experience.
