# Traffic Density Estimation and Signal Prediction Using YOLOv11s

## Description

This project utilizes a YOLOv11s model to perform real-time traffic density estimation and predict traffic signal states. The system analyzes video footage of a road, detects and counts vehicles in different lanes, and determines the traffic intensity to control traffic lights accordingly. It's worth noting that "YOLOv11s" is likely an unofficial or custom-trained version of a YOLO model, as there is no official YOLOv11 release.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a custom dataset of traffic images. This dataset is expected to be provided in a compressed file named `Data_Traffic.zip` in the `/content/` directory. The dataset should be organized in a way that is compatible with YOLO model training, with a corresponding YAML file for configuration.
